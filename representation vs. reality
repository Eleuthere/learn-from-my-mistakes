A mistake that we sometimes do : take a representation of the reality as the reality.

Which can sometimes have funny consequences.

In a certain bank system, the civil status of a customer is used. Is the customer single, married, divorced, dead, alive, etc. The customer can die.
In principle, customers can't come back to life. So our computer engineers team builds a function that enable a bank employee to "kill" a customer, that is
that makes it possible to change the status of the customer from alive to dead. Of course, it is not necessary to make it possible to bring a customer back to
life, because that never happens. Or so they think.

And so this happens. In the "rue du Pont" live two men with the same name : "Jean Legrand". One of them dies. And this fact comes to the ears of the bank
employee who works at the branch at the corner of the "rue du Pont". As a good employee, in order to protect the heirs of the deceased and the bank, 
the employee mentions the death of Jean Legrand in the computer system of the bank. But the wrong ones got picked up. The employee mentions the death of the old 
Jean Legrand, but it's the young one who died.

So, Jean Legrand, the dead one, keeps his accounts open and unprotected, while the still living Jean Legrand sees his accounts closed, cannot pay his rent, his 
invoices, buy food, buy petrol, get a train or a metro ticket, etc. Of course, he goes to the branch of the bank to show that he is alive. The employees tell him
that they will sort that out. But at the branch level, nothing is foreseen for that situation, so they send the problem to the head office. Where nothing for that
is foreseen either. The computer engineers who made the developments can't do anything for obvious security reasons. They have no access to the data. And the 
computer engineers who manage the production environment, they have access to the data, but not to the tools that would allow them to modify the data, for the 
same obvious security reasons.

Meanwhile, Jean Legrand, the dead one, has his body cold already for a long time, while Jean Legrand, alive but delared deceased, lives an impossible life. And 
begins to think that enough is enough. He goes to the local television broadcasting corporation. And so, Jean Legrand, alive but declared deceased, will be 
interviewed, during prime time, right in front of the bank's head office. All's well that ends well, and the next day the computer engineers of the bank had 
finally made the corrections.
